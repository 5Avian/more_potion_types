More Potion Types adds a Big Potion and a Small Potion to the game.

The Small Potion has 0.75x duration and 1.25x drink speed. It shatters after usage.

The Big Potion has 1.5x duration and 0.5x drink speed.

For modpack makers, I recommend rebalancing the potion stack sizes using a stack size-changing mod like [AllStackable](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/all-stackable).
